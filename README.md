# Tweeter_Scraper
Scrape the new V2 API.

Created to integrate Twitter's V2 API, all you need is the bearer token which can now be done in the Twitter developer's platfrom instead of in code.

Paste this code in the bearer variable for your script, of save it in ENV / .env file and call it with os or you'r method of choice for security...
